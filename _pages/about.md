I am an Assistant Professor of the School of Information, Renmin University of China. Currently, I am working closely with Professor [Ju Fan](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~fanj/). Before joining Renmin University of China, I am a researcher at AI Theory Group of Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Probability and Mathematical Statistics from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Math from Central China Normal University in 2017.

__Hiring__: I am looking for MS/Phd/Interns with strong machine learning and mathematical background in School of Information, Renmin University of China. Please drop me an [email](yimingyang@ruc.edu.cn) if you are interested in machine learning theory, optimization, or generative model.
